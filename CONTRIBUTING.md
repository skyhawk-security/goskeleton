## Guidelines

- <p><strong>Adding everything available out there is not the goal!</strong><br />
  The roadmaps represent the skillset most valuable today, i.e., if you were to enter any of the listed fields today, what would you learn?! There might be things that are of-course being used today but prioritize the things that are most in demand today, e.g., agreed that lots of people are using angular.js today but you wouldn't want to learn that instead of React, Angular, or Vue. Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included.</p>
- <p><strong>Do not add things you have not evaluated personally!</strong><br />
  Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included. Have you read this book? Can you give a short article?</p>
- <p><strong>Create a Single PR for Content Additions</strong></p>

  If you are planning to contribute by adding content to the roadmaps, I recommend you to clone the repository, add content to the [content directory of the roadmap](./src/data/roadmaps/) and create a single PR to make it easier for me to review and merge the PR.
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones
